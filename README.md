# 📱 BasicCalculator (KUAL Extension)

Hello!  
This is a simple **calculator KUAL extension** I made, using [justrals’ KindleFetch](https://github.com/justrals/kindlefetch) as a template.  
Big thanks to **justrals** for the base project! 🙏

I plan to make it **KPM / KindleForge** compatible soon.  
**LONG LIVE JAILBREAKING** 🔓✨
